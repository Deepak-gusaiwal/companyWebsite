                        <p>App Stores are the digital platforms available on the web that allow the distribution of multiple industry mobile software known as Mobile Applications. These App Stores allow multiple-industry applications to be distributed from their platforms which users can install as per their requirements and need use.

                        <h2>What is App Store Optimization?</h2>
                        <p>App Store Optimization is a process to improve mobile app search presence on App Stores as well as on Google search in order to increase the app installations by users or by a set of targeted audiences for which the mobile app could be useful. App store optimization is a practice that includes a process in which we optimize an app from the App Store (On-Site App Store Optimization) as well as Out of App Store (Off-Side App Store Optimization). Both practices together help an app to appear on the top of all targeted keywords and in front of the targeted audience.</p>
