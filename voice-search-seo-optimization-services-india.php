                        <h1>The New King of Search Engines — Voice-Based Searches.</h1>
                        <p>Reports published in 2020 indicate some startling yet promising facts concerning voice-based web searches.
                        </p>
                      <p>According to one of the studies, voice-based commerce is predicted to reach $40 billion by 2022. According to the IMF, 105 nations in the globe have a GDP of fewer than 40 billion dollars.</p>
                      <p>Per another study, 55 per cent of centennials use voice search on a daily basis. Based on these statistics, it is not an exaggeration to state that people today prefer voice search to typing-based searches</p>
                      <p>In such a scenario, if a marketer or website owner does not optimize his company website for voice search, he is purposefully restricting the growth of his business.</p>
