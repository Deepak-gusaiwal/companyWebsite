           <h2>SO, WHAT DOES PRESS RELEASE WRITING INVOLVE?</h2>
           <p>Foremost, a press release should contain information about something that is new and interesting. If the subject matter is not something that will interest or excite the target audience, it is unlikely that the contents will end up as a feature story. Secondly, a press release should be informative. It is necessary to provide all the information needed by the reader to create a full story.</p>
           <p>Having a strong, eye-catching heading can help your press release get noticed and not end up in the junk or trash folders of your target. In addition, the press release should not overly promote your business. It should be a factual document.</p>
           <p>Using professional press release writing services could give your article the edge it needs to capture the attention of the reader and ensure that your new business, goods or services are aptly promoted.</p>
