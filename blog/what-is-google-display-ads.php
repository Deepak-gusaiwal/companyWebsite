                            What is Google Display Ads?</h1>
                        <p>
                            Hey, do you want to know how to create awesome display ads for your business? Display ads
                            are those Image Ads that you see on different websites or apps. They&rsquo;re great for
                            getting your brand out there, reaching new people, or bringing back old customers.</p>
                        <p>
                            Display ads are part of a Display campaign, which is one of the ways you can advertise on
                            Google. A Display campaign lets you show your ads on a huge network of websites, mobile
                            apps, and video content that covers over 90% of the internet users in the world. You can
                            choose who sees your ads based on what they&rsquo;re interested in, or if they&rsquo;ve
                            visited your website before.</p>

                        <h2>
                            Types of Google Display Ads:</h2>
                        <p>
                            There are two kinds of display ads you can use in a Display campaign:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Uploaded Display Ads:</strong> These are ads that you make and upload yourself
                                using specific sizes
                                and formats. You have more control over how they look, but they might not fit everywhere
                                or
                                on every device.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong> Responsive Display Ads:</strong> These are ads that Google makes and changes
                                for you using things
                                that you give them, like headlines, descriptions, images, and logos. You have less
                                control
                                over how they look, but they can change to fit anywhere or on any device.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <h2>
                            Pros and Cons of Google&#39;s Display Ads</h2>
                        <p>
                            Just like anything else, Google&#39;s display ads have their advantages and disadvantages.
                            Here are a few of them:</p>
                        <h3>
                            Pros:</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                You can reach people who are browsing the web, not just searching on Google, which means
                                you can expand your reach and visibility.</li>
                            <li>
                                You can use different types of display ads, such as uploaded or responsive, to suit your
                                goals and preferences.</li>
                            <li>
                                You can use different targeting options, such as keywords, topics, placements,
                                audiences, or demographics, to show your ads to the right people.</li>
                            <li>
                                You can measure and optimize your performance using data and insights from Google Ads.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                You can remarket to people who have already visited your website but who haven&rsquo;t
                                yet taken action, which is a great way to remind them of your offer.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3>
                            Cons:</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                You may face low click-through rates and conversions, as people may not be interested in
                                your ads or may have banner blindness.</li>
                            <li>
                                You may need to invest time and money in designing attractive and engaging display ads
                                that stand out from the clutter.</li>
                            <li>
                                You may need to monitor and update your ads regularly to keep up with changing customer
                                behaviour and market trends.</li>
                            <li>
                                You may need to comply with Google&rsquo;s advertising policies and guidelines, which
                                can be strict and complex at times.</li>
                        </ul>
