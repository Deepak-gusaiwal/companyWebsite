			What is Google Discovery Ad?</h1>
		<p>
			Have you ever wondered how to reach more customers online without them having to search for you? Google Discovery Ads can help you do that. They are a type of native advertising that allows you to reach potential customers across Google&rsquo;s properties, such as Google Discover, YouTube, and Gmail, with visually rich and engaging ads. Unlike Google Search Ads, people don&rsquo;t need to enter a search query to see these ads. Google uses its machine learning and customer intent technology to show relevant ads to users based on their interests, behavior, and preferences.</p>
		<p>
			If you want to create Discovery Ads for your business, you need some creative assets, like your images, logo, and text. You also need a budget that can cover at least 10 times your target Cost Per Action (CPA) bid. And you need to set up some tracking and follow some rules for personalized ads. Once you have all that, you can start setting up your campaign in Google Ads.</p>

		<p>
			<strong>You can choose from two types of Discovery Ads:</strong></p>
		<p>
			<strong>- Single-Image Ads: </strong>These ads show one image with some text and your logo. They are simple but effective at grabbing attention.</p>
		<p>
			<strong>- Carousel Ads:</strong> These ads show multiple images that people can swipe through. They are more interactive and let you showcase more of your products or services.</p>
		<p>
			Both types of Discovery Ads can help you reach more customers who are searching for things like what you offer on Google. And they are fully automated, so you don&#39;t have to worry about the details like bidding, targeting, or placements. Google will do all that for you.</p>
