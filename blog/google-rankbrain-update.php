			Google RankBrain Update: Relevance, Impact and SEO Best Practices</h1>
		<p>
			Google RankBrain is a machine learning algorithm that was first announced in 2015. It is designed to help Google better understand the intent of search queries and to rank websites more relevantly.</p>
		<p>
			RankBrain is one of the most important factors in Google&#39;s ranking algorithm, and it has had a significant impact on SEO. In the past, SEOs could focus on optimizing their websites for specific keywords. However, with RankBrain, it is more important to create high-quality content that is relevant to the user&#39;s intent.</p>
		<p>
			<strong>There are a few things that SEOs can do to adapt to RankBrain:</strong></p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				Create content that is informative and helpful.</li>
			<li>
				Use natural language keywords throughout your content.</li>
			<li>
				Make sure your website is easy to use and navigate.</li>
			<li>
				Build backlinks from high-quality websites.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			RankBrain is still a relatively new algorithm, and it is constantly evolving. However, by following these best practices, SEOs can ensure that their websites are ranked highly in Google&#39;s search results.</p>
		<h2>
			What is Google RankBrain Update and When Did It Take Off?</h2>
		<p>
			Google RankBrain is a machine learning algorithm that was first announced in October 2015. It is designed to help Google better understand the intent of search queries and to rank websites more relevantly.</p>
		<p>
			RankBrain is a significant part of Google&#39;s ranking algorithm, and it is estimated to influence up to 15% of all search results. It is still a relatively new algorithm, but it has already had a major impact on SEO.</p>
		<h2>
			What Inspired Google to Launch RankBrain Update and What Does It Mean for SEOs?</h2>
		<p>
			Google launched RankBrain in response to the increasing complexity of search queries. As people use more natural language to search, it becomes more difficult for Google to understand the intent of their queries. RankBrain helps Google to overcome this challenge by using machine learning to learn from the way people interact with search results.</p>
		<p>
			For SEOs, RankBrain means that they need to focus on creating high-quality content that is relevant to the user&#39;s intent. They also need to make sure that their websites are easy to use and navigate. By following these best practices, SEOs can ensure that their websites are ranked highly in Google&#39;s search results.</p>
		<h2>
			How RankBrain Update Lifted or Dropped Websites and SEOs in the Past?</h2>
		<p>
			There have been a number of cases where RankBrain has had a significant impact on the rankings of websites. For example, in 2016, RankBrain was credited with helping to improve the rankings of websites that focused on local search.</p>
		<p>
			In other cases, RankBrain has been responsible for dropping websites from the top of the search results. For example, in 2017, RankBrain was reportedly responsible for dropping a number of websites that were focused on black hat SEO techniques.</p>
		<h2>
			How SEOs Adapted to RankBrain Update: Best Practices and Pitfalls</h2>
		<p>
			SEOs have adapted to RankBrain in a number of ways. One common practice is to focus on creating high-quality content that is relevant to the user&#39;s intent. SEOs are also making sure that their websites are easy to use and navigate.</p>
		<p>
			Another way that SEOs have adapted to RankBrain is by using machine learning tools to help them understand how Google is ranking websites. These tools can help SEOs to identify potential problems with their websites and to make changes that will improve their rankings.</p>
		<p>
			However, there are also some pitfalls that SEOs need to be aware of when it comes to RankBrain. For example, it is important to avoid keyword stuffing and to focus on creating natural language content. SEOs should also avoid using black hat SEO techniques, as these can lead to their websites being penalized by Google.</p>
		<h2>
			How to Manage RankBrain Update and Rise in Local Search and SEO in 2023?</h2>
		<p>
			In 2023, SEOs will need to continue to adapt to the changing landscape of search. This includes managing the impact of RankBrain and the rise in local search.</p>
		<p>
			To manage the impact of RankBrain, SEOs should focus on creating high-quality content that is relevant to the user&#39;s intent. They should also make sure that their websites are easy to use and navigate.</p>
		<p>
			To stay ahead of the curve in local search, SEOs should focus on creating local content and building relationships with local businesses. They should also make sure that their websites are optimized for local search.</p>
		<p>
			By following these tips, SEOs can ensure that their websites are ranked highly in Google&#39;s search results in 2023 and beyond.</p>
