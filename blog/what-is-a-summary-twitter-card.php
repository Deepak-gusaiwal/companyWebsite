			What is a Summary Twitter Card?</h1>
		<p>
			Do you like to share your stuff on Twitter? If you do, you may have seen some tweets that show a cool preview of the link they have, with a title, description, and image. These are called Summary cards, and they make your tweets look awesome and inviting.</p>

		<p>
			Summary cards are a kind of Twitter card, which is a thing that lets you add rich media to your tweets. You can create them by putting some meta tags on your webpage. Meta tags are bits of code that tell Twitter what kind of card you want and what info to put on it. When you or someone else tweets a link to your content, the card will show up below the tweet, so people can see what it&#39;s about before they click on it.</p>
		<p>
			Summary cards work well for many types of web content, like blog posts, news articles, products, or restaurants. They can help you get more people to visit your website, know your brand, and rank higher on Google. They also make your posts look consistent across different platforms and devices.</p>
		<h2>
			Key Features of Summary Cards</h2>
		<p>
			Here are some of the key features of a summary card:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				The title is displayed prominently at the top of the card.</li>
			<li>
				The thumbnail image is displayed below the title.</li>
			<li>
				The description is displayed below the image.</li>
			<li>
				The card is linked to the original content, so users can click on it to view it in full.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			Summary cards are a great way to promote your content on Twitter. They can help to attract more attention to your tweets, increase the click-through rate (CTR) of your links, and drive traffic to your website.</p>
