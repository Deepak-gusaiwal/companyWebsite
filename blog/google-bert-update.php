                            Google BERT Update: Relevance, Impact and SEO Best Practices</h1>
                        <p>
                            Google is constantly updating its algorithm to provide better search results for its users.
                            One of the most significant updates in recent years was the BERT update, which was launched
                            in October 2019 and affected 10% of all search queries. BERT stands for Bidirectional
                            Encoder Representations from Transformers, and it is a deep learning technique that helps
                            Google understand the natural language and context of search queries.</p>
                        <h2>
                            What is Google BERT Update and When Did It Take Off?</h2>
                        <p>
                            The BERT update is a way for Google to better understand the meaning and intent behind
                            search queries, especially those that are long, conversational, or use prepositions. For
                            example, before the BERT update, if you searched for &quot;parking on a hill with no
                            curb&quot;, Google might have focused on the word &quot;curb&quot; and shown you results
                            about parking on a hill with a curb. But after the BERT update, Google can understand that
                            the word &quot;no&quot; is important and show you results about parking on a hill without a
                            curb.</p>
                        <p>
                            The BERT update was first announced by Google on October 25, 2019, and it was rolled out for
                            English language queries in the US. Later, it was expanded to more languages and regions,
                            and it also applied to featured snippets. According to Google, the BERT update affects 10%
                            of all search queries, which makes it one of the biggest updates in Google&#39;s history.

                        <h2>
                            What Inspired Google to Launch BERT Update and What Does It Mean for SEOs?</h2>
                        <p>
                            Google&#39;s mission is to organize the world&#39;s information and make it universally
                            accessible and useful. To do that, Google needs to understand what users are looking for and
                            provide them with relevant and high-quality results. However, natural language is complex
                            and nuanced, and sometimes users don&#39;t use the exact keywords or phrases that match the
                            content on the web. That&#39;s why Google developed the BERT update, which uses artificial
                            intelligence and machine learning to analyze the context and relationships between words in
                            a query.</p>
                        <p>
                            For SEOs, this means that keyword optimization is not enough to rank well on Google. SEOs
                            need to focus more on creating content that matches the user intent and provides value to
                            the readers. SEOs also need to use natural language and avoid keyword stuffing or unnatural
                            phrasing. The BERT update rewards content that is well-written, informative, and relevant to
                            the query.</p>
                        <h2>
                            How BERT Update Lifted or Dropped Websites and SEOs in the Past?</h2>
                        <p>
                            The BERT update had a significant impact on many websites and SEOs, especially those that
                            relied on long-tail keywords or featured snippets. Some websites saw an increase in traffic
                            and rankings, while others saw a decrease or no change at all. The impact of the BERT update
                            depended on how well the content matched the user intent and answered the query.</p>
                        <p>
                            For example, one of the winners of the BERT update was Healthline.com, a health information
                            website that provides clear and accurate answers to common health questions. Healthline.com
                            saw an increase in organic traffic and featured snippets after the BERT update, because its
                            content was relevant and helpful to the users.</p>
                        <p>
                            On the other hand, one of the losers of the BERT update was Dictionary.com, an online
                            dictionary that provides definitions and synonyms of words. Dictionary.com saw a decrease in
                            organic traffic and featured snippets after the BERT update, because its content was not as
                            relevant or useful to the users as other sources.</p>
                        <h2>
                            How SEOs Adapted to BERT Update: Best Practices and Pitfalls</h2>
                        <p>
                            The BERT update changed the way SEOs approach content creation and optimization. SEOs had to
                            adapt to the new algorithm and follow some best practices to rank well on Google. Some of
                            these best practices are:</p>
                            <ul>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Write For Humans, Not for Machines:</strong> Use natural language and avoid keyword stuffing or
                                unnatural phrasing.</li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Focus On User Intent, Not on Keywords:</strong> Understand what users are
                                looking for and provide them with valuable content that answers their questions.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Optimize For Featured Snippets:</strong> Use clear headings, bullet points,
                                lists, tables, images, etc. to structure your content and make it easy for Google to
                                extract relevant information.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Use Long-Tail Keywords Wisely:</strong> Don&#39;t rely on them as your main
                                strategy, but use them as modifiers or variations of your main keywords.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Monitor your performance regularly:</strong> Use tools like Google Search
                                Console or Google Analytics to track your traffic, rankings, impressions, clicks, etc.
                                and identify any changes or opportunities.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            Some of the pitfalls that SEOs should avoid are:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Ignoring the BERT Update:</strong> Don&#39;t assume that your content is immune
                                to the algorithm changes or that you don&#39;t need to improve your content quality or
                                relevance.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Over-Optimizing for the BERT Update:</strong> Don&#39;t try to manipulate or
                                trick the algorithm by using unnatural language or irrelevant content.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Neglecting Other Ranking Factors:</strong> Don&#39;t forget that the BERT update
                                is not the only factor that affects your rankings. You still need to consider other
                                factors like site speed, mobile-friendliness, backlinks, user experience, etc.
                            </li>

                            How to Manage BERT Update and Rise in Local Search and SEO in 2023?</h3>
                        <p>
                            The BERT update is not a one-time event, but an ongoing process that Google will continue to
                            improve and refine. SEOs need to keep up with the latest developments and trends in search
                            and SEO, and prepare for the future challenges and opportunities. One of the most important
                            trends that SEOs need to pay attention to is the rise of local search and SEO in 2023.</p>
                        <p>
                            Local search is the process of finding and displaying relevant results based on the
                            user&#39;s location or geographic intent. Local SEO is the practice of optimizing your
                            website and online presence for local search. According to Google, 46% of all searches have
                            a local intent, and 88% of users who do a local search on their smartphone visit or call a
                            store within a day. Local search and SEO are crucial for businesses that want to attract and
                            retain local customers, especially in the post-pandemic era.</p>
                        <p>
                            To manage the BERT update and rise in local search and SEO in 2023, SEOs need to follow some
                            strategies, such as:</p>

                            <ul>

                        <li>
                            <strong>Claim And Optimize Your Google My Business Profile:</strong> This is a free tool that allows you to
                            manage your business information, reviews, photos, posts, etc. on Google Search and Maps. It
                            also helps you rank higher on local search results and featured snippets.</li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Optimize Your Website for Local Keywords:</strong> Use keywords that include your location, service
                            area, or landmarks. For example, instead of using &quot;dentist&quot;, use &quot;dentist in
                            New Delhi&quot; or &quot;dentist near India Gate&quot;.</li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Create Local Content:</strong> Write blog posts, articles, videos, etc. that are relevant and
                            useful to your local audience. For example, you can write about local events, news, tips,
                            reviews, etc.</li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Build Local Citations and Links:</strong> Citations are online mentions of your business name,
                            address, phone number, etc. on other websites or directories. Links are hyperlinks from
                            other websites to your website. Both citations and links help you increase your online
                            visibility and authority on local search results.</li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Encourage And Respond to Customer Reviews:</strong> Reviews are one of the most important factors
                            that influence your local rankings and reputation. Ask your customers to leave reviews on
                            Google, Yelp, Facebook, etc. and respond to them politely and professionally.</li>
