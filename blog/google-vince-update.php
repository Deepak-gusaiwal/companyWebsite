			Google Vince Update: Relevance, Impact and SEO Best Practices</h1>
		<p>
			Google Vince Update was an algorithm update that Google launched in 2009 to favor big brand websites in the search results for broad and competitive keywords. The update was named after a Google engineer who worked on it, and it was announced by Matt Cutts, then head of Google&#39;s webspam team. The update had a significant impact on the rankings and traffic of many websites, especially those that were not well-known or trusted by users.</p>
		<h2>
			What is Google Vince Update and When Did It Take Off?</h2>
		<p>
			Google Vince Update was an update that involved changing Google&#39;s algorithm to give more weight to brand signals, such as domain authority, trust, reputation, user behavior, etc. The update was announced by Matt Cutts in February 2009, and it started to roll out gradually over several weeks. The update affected mainly the search results for broad and competitive keywords, such as &quot;car insurance&quot;, &quot;credit cards&quot;, &quot;flights&quot;, etc. The update gave more visibility to big brand websites, such as Amazon, Wikipedia, eBay, etc., and less visibility to smaller or less-known websites.</p>
		<h2>

		<p>
			Google Vince Update means that SEOs need to pay attention to their brand signals and reputation. SEOs need to ensure that their websites are trustworthy, authoritative, popular and user-friendly.

			<li>
				<strong>Optimizing the website</strong> or the business listing with relevant keywords, categories, descriptions, photos, reviews, etc.</li>
			<li>
				Encouraging customers to leave positive <strong>reviews and ratings on Google</strong> or other platforms, and responding to them promptly and professionally.</li>
			<li>
				Building <strong>citations</strong> or mentions of the business or service on other reputable websites or directories, such as <strong>Yelp</strong>, <strong>Facebook</strong>, etc.</li>
			<li>
				Creating <strong>local content or landing pages</strong> that target specific locations or areas where the business or service operates.</li>
