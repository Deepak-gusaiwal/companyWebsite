			Google Fred Update: Relevance, Impact and SEO Best Practices</h1>
		<p>
			Google&#39;s Fred algorithm update was a significant shakeup for the SEO landscape in 2017. The update targeted low-quality websites that relied on thin content and aggressive ad placement, and it had a major impact on the rankings of many sites.</p>
		<h2>
			What is Google Fred Update and When Did It Take Off?</h2>
		<p>
			Google Fred is an algorithm update that was first rolled out on March 7, 2017. The update was named after Gary Illyes, a Google Search Advocate, who jokingly referred to it as &quot;Fred&quot; because Google didn&#39;t give it a formal name.</p>
		<p>
			Fred was designed to target low-quality websites that were providing poor user experiences. These sites often had thin content, excessive ads, and poor design. Fred penalized these sites in the search results, which caused their rankings to drop.</p>
		<h2>
			What Inspired Google to Launch Fred Update and What Does It Mean for SEOs?</h2>
		<p>
			Google launched Fred in response to feedback from users. Many users were complaining about the poor quality of the search results, and Google wanted to address these concerns.</p>
		<p>
			Fred had a significant impact on the SEO landscape. Many websites that relied on thin content and aggressive ad placement saw their rankings drop. This forced SEOs to adapt their strategies and focus on creating high-quality content that would provide a good user experience.</p>
		<h2>
			How Fred Update Lifted or Dropped Websites and SEOs in the Past?</h2>
		<p>
			The impact of Fred on individual websites and SEOs varied. Some websites saw their rankings drop significantly, while others were unaffected. However, the overall impact of Fred was to improve the quality of the search results.</p>
		<h2>
			How SEOs Adapted to Fred Update: Best Practices and Pitfalls</h2>
		<p>
			SEOs adapted to Fred by focusing on creating high-quality content that would provide a good user experience. This included creating longer, more informative articles, reducing the number of ads on pages, and improving the overall design of websites.</p>
		<p>
			Some SEOs also tried to game the system by creating thin content that was specifically designed to target Fred. However, these efforts were ultimately unsuccessful, and Google was able to identify and penalize these websites.</p>
		<h2>
			How to Manage Fred Update and Rise in Local Search and SEO in 2023?</h2>
		<p>
			The Fred update is still a factor in the SEO landscape, and it&#39;s important for SEOs to be aware of its implications. However, the overall impact of Fred has lessened in recent years. This is due to a number of factors, including the rise of local search and the increasing importance of user experience.</p>
		<p>
			In 2023, SEOs will need to focus on creating high-quality content that is relevant to local users. They will also need to optimize their websites for mobile devices, as more and more people are using their phones to search for information.</p>
