			What are Google Shopping Ads?</h1>
		<p>
			Have you ever wondered why we see a bunch of ads after we search for something on Google? Those right there are Google Shopping Ads, and they&rsquo;re a great way to show off your products to potential buyers. These Display Ads have everything a shopper needs to know: a photo, a title, a price, and your store name. And they show up when people are looking for things like what you sell, either on the main search page or on the Shopping tab.</p>
		<p>
			If you want to create Shopping Ads for your products, you need two things: a Google Merchant Center account and a Google Ads account. In your Merchant Center account, you upload your product data, which tells Google what your products are, what they look like, how much they cost, and where to find them. In your Google Ads account, you create a campaign to run your Shopping Ads.</p>

		<h2>
			There Are Two Kinds of Shopping Ads You Can Create:</h2>
            <ul>
                
		<li>
			<strong>Product Shopping Ads:</strong> These ads show one product at a time, with its photo, title, price, and store name. You can create these ads by providing your product data in your Merchant Center account.</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Local Inventory Ads:</strong> These ads show products that you have in stock at your nearby stores. They&rsquo;re perfect for attracting local customers who want to buy from you in person. You can create these ads by providing your local product data and inventory in your Merchant Center account.</li>
            
            </ul>
		<p>
			Both kinds of Shopping Ads can help you reach more customers who are searching for products like yours on Google. And if you want to take it to the next level, you can use Performance Max campaigns with your Merchant Center feed. This way, you can create Shopping Ads along with other types of ads that show up on different places on Google, like YouTube, Gmail, or Discover.</p>
