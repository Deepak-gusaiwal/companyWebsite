                            Well, SEO stands for Search Engine Optimization, and it&rsquo;s all about boosting your
                            website&rsquo;s visibility on the Search Engines like Google and Bing. Think of it as giving
                            your website a little boost so that it attracts more organic traffic, which means people
                            find you naturally without being promoted through paid ads.</p>
                        <p>
                            In practice, <strong>SEO includes activities such as</strong></p>
