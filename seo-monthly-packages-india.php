            <h2>Why Our SEO Monthly Packages Worth for You?</h2>
            <p>Our team of SEO Experts in India are trained in a manner; they keep on rotating the OFF-Page activities
                by including different Out of the Box Link Building Techniques. Generally, we take a time frame of 3-4
                months to get the best results, but after 2 months we will change the Off-Page plan by removing the
                activities that are not able to get enough leads and are not adding enough value to the project, They
                will be completely removed from the monthly SEO package and monthly tasks.</p>
            <h2>Things We Avoid in SEO Packages India?</h2>
            <p>In our On-Page activities, we deliver each and every possible activity in all the different types of
                plans that can play a crucial role in the optimization of your website.</p>
            <p>Honestly, we work only for the website users and deliver them a platform which is easy to use and
                understand, which also helps website’s to get found in the search engine results easily.</p>
            <p>As many SEO companies do, they work for the search engines and crawlers just to boost up the rankings,
                which impacts badly on the online reputation of the website because they perform spam stuff while
                optimizing the website, But at SEO Services India, we strictly avoid to perform this kind of activities,
                we make your website real for the crawlers as well as for the users, which helps to build a trust for
                your brand in the online place. Which is one of the best part of our SEO Packages in India.</p>
