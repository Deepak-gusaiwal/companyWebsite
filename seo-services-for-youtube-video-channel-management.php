            <h3>This mantra emphasizes three key principles:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <strong>Consistency:</strong> Regularly upload new content to your YouTube channel. Consistency
                    establishes expectations among your viewers and helps build a loyal subscriber base. Set a
                    consistent schedule for uploading videos and stick to it.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Quality: </strong>Focus on creating high-quality content that provides value to your target
                    audience. Invest in good equipment, improve your production skills, and deliver content that is
                    informative, entertaining, or both. Quality content encourages viewers to subscribe, engage, and
                    share your videos with others.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Engagement:</strong> Actively engage with your audience by responding to comments, asking
                    for feedback, and encouraging discussions. Building a community around your channel creates a sense
                    of belonging and fosters a loyal and supportive viewership. Additionally, collaborate with other
                    creators, participate in relevant communities, and promote your videos across different platforms to
                    expand your reach and attract new viewers.
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>By following this guru mantra of consistency, quality, and engagement, you can establish a strong foundation for the growth and success of your YouTube channel.</p>
