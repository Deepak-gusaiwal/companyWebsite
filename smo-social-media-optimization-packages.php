                <h2>What Is Social Media Optimization (SMO)?</h2>
             <p>SMO is an acronym for social media optimization. This practice entails using social media platforms to manage and promote an organization’s value proposition. Under SMO, your value propositions on social media platforms can be tailored to have a better impact on certain groups of people.  Professional digital marketers, such as us, can use social networks to tailor their clients’ site content based on demographic and geographic characteristics. Altogether, social media optimization can be used to promote consciousness of new products and services, interact with consumers, and mitigate potentially harmful online influences to your brand.</p>
