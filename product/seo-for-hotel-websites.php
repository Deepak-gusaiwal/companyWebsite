            <p>
                When you use a search engine like Google to hunt for anything, a succession of split-second judgments is
                made based on a big number of parameters. The sites that appear first in the results are ranked
                depending on these characteristics, and the site that appears first may have a better result in one area
                than another, which is why it appears first than second.
            </p>

            <p>
                SEO helps you to optimize these ranking indicators and appear higher in search results. This may not
                seem crucial on its own—you may not care whether you’re #1 as long as you’re on the first page—but
                consider this: according to studies, the first result in a Google search receives roughly 33% of clicks.
                For the second outcome, the proportion reduces to 17%. You’re lucky if you receive 1% if you’re on page
                two!
            </p>
