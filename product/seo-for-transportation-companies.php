          <h1>SEO for Transport Companies, SEO for Transportation Firms</h1>
          <p>Today’s transportation and logistics businesses are striving for higher levels of productivity and profitability. While transportation focuses on moving items from one location to another, logistics encompasses a larger scope and refers to the entire “flow management” in the service sector.</p>
          <p>However, there is a significant distinction between these two areas of action. Logistics is responsible for storage, inventory, handling, and packing of items in addition to transportation and delivery. It is the science of getting, creating, and disseminating materials and goods in the appropriate location and amount.</p>
