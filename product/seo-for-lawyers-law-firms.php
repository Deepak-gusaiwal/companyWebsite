            <h4>EVALUATE YOUR CURRENT DOMAIN NAME AND WEBSITE
            </h4>
            <p>Following that, we assess your law firm’s website and domain name to see if they are available for usage.
                While having a high Google ranking is critical for generating leads online, if your website does not
                convert visitors, you are wasting money and losing new cases to your competitors. Additionally,
                depending on how your website was constructed, it may be contributing to your website’s bad rankings and
                preventing you from ranking highly on Google.
            </p>
            <p>Our technical SEO expert will analyze your present website to determine page load times, crawlability,
                mobile compatibility, and general SEO friendliness. Regarding your domain name, Our SEO For Lawyers
                Experts will run a backlink study to ensure that you do not have a link profile that would hinder you
                from ranking highly on Google. If your domain has been penalized manually or algorithmically as a result
                of bad links or over-optimized anchor text, you may need to register a new domain name to avoid wasting
                time and money optimizing a penalized domain.</p>

            <h4>ANALYZE MARKET COMPETITION</h4>

            <p>We will examine the first page of Google search results for the keywords you wish to rank for to
                ascertain who your online competitors are and the level of competition. We then analyze the top five to
                determine the strength of the competition – as this is who you will face online. How do those websites
                stack up against your own? Which websites have the best conversion rate? How effective is their search
                engine optimization? What strategies do they employ to achieve high rankings? What opportunities do we
                see?
