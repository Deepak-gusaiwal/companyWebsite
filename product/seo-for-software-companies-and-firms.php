            <p>
            You can take one of three pathways, depending on your needs. The first option is to conduct a technical assessment of your website to enhance the effectiveness of your other initiatives. Another option is to work with your existing material to optimize what you already have and generate what you’ll need to fill in the gaps. Another way to get started is to join a content marketing program right away.
            </p>

            <p>
            Of course, all of these options are contingent on the website and your long-term company objectives.
            </p>
