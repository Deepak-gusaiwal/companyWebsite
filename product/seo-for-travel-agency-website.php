            <h2 class="fs-1 ">When It Comes To Travel, Why Do You Need SEO?</h2>
            <p>
            According to Google Research, 57 percent of leisure travelers and 64% of business travelers start their trip preparation by looking up information online. With this information, a clever travel SEO plan may help your company appear when these customers are looking.
            </p>

            <p>
            Of course, using sponsored search to target a potential audience is a sensible technique. However, because just 39% of search results pages feature advert, this leaves more than half of the audience on the sidelines! To put this in perspective, this implies that almost 60% of the 1.2 trillion searches performed each year are free of advertising. As a result, appearing in organic search results is the only way to acquire part of this crucial traffic.
